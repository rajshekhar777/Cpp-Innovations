## Planned Projects
Here is a list of projects that I am currently working on or plan to develop in the future:

1. **Multithreaded Web Server**
   - A web server capable of handling multiple client requests concurrently using multithreading.

2. **File System Explorer**
   - An application to navigate, search, and manipulate the file system with a graphical or command-line interface.

3. **Real-Time Task Scheduler**
   - A scheduler for managing tasks with real-time constraints, designed to optimize CPU usage and task prioritization.

4. **Chat Application (Sockets)**
   - A real-time chat application built using socket programming for communication between clients and servers.

5. **Linux Character Device Driver**
   - A custom character device driver for the Linux operating system to handle I/O operations.

6. **Memory Management Simulator**
   - A simulator for memory management techniques, illustrating concepts like paging, segmentation, and allocation.

7. **Algorithm Visualizer**
   - A tool to visualize various algorithms, such as sorting and searching, with step-by-step graphical representation.

8. **Smart Home Controller Simulation**
   - A simulation project to demonstrate the control and automation of smart home devices.

9. **STL Data Structures**
   - Implementation and examples of Standard Template Library (STL) data structures, including vectors, lists, sets, and maps.

10. **Mini Compiler**
    - A basic compiler capable of parsing and translating a subset of programming language constructs into machine code or intermediate code.

## How to Use
