# Chat Application using Sockets

## Description
This project implements a client-server chat application using TCP/IP sockets in C++. The server supports multiple clients using multithreading, and communication between the client and server is encrypted using OpenSSL.

## Features
- **Multithreaded Server**: The server can handle multiple clients simultaneously.
- **Encrypted Communication**: Messages exchanged between the client and server are encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux-based systems.

## Prerequisites
- **OpenSSL** installed on your system.
- A **C++ compiler** supporting C++11 or newer (e.g., g++).
- Certificates: `server.crt` and `server.key` for SSL/TLS encryption.

## Installation Instructions
1. Install OpenSSL if not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

2. Generate SSL certificates (self-signed)
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt

# Compilation Instructions
To compile both the server and client programs, use the following commands:

    g++ server.cpp -o server -lssl -lcrypto -pthread
    g++ client.cpp -o client -lssl -lcrypto

# ** Running the Application

# Start the server on port 4444:
./server

# Start the client to connect to the server:
./client
